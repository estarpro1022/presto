The implemented animation effect allows slides to transition smoothly by sliding in and out from the left or right, depending on the direction of navigation. When the user moves to the next slide, the current slide slides out to the left, and the new slide slides in from the right. Similarly, when navigating to the previous slide, the current slide slides out to the right, and the previous slide slides in from the left. This creates a natural flow, as if flipping through physical slides, which enhances the overall experience.
